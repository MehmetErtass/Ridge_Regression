# Ridge_Regression
1-Data Loading and Cleaning: In the first step, we loaded the dataset, "AutoMobileData.csv," and cleaned the data. We filled in missing data, corrected data types, and processed categorical variables.

2-Data Exploration: Various visualizations were used to explore the data. Distribution plots, pair plots, and a correlation heatmap were created.

3-Ridge Regression Model: We built a Ridge Regression model and found the best alpha parameter using GridSearchCV. The model's performance was evaluated with various metrics.

4-Results: The model's performance was presented with metrics such as mean absolute error, explained variance, and R-squared, demonstrating how well the model makes predictions.

5-Usage: You can use this code to make your own automobile price predictions or as a starting point for regression problems. You can reproduce the analysis using the Jupyter Notebook file.

6-Requirements: To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the libraries and dependencies used in the project. The libraries and dependencies are specified in the Jupyter Notebook.
